== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

|Issue
|Explanation

|Free time
|The amount of work required for this course project (3 hours of autonomous work per 2 hours of class) may prove problematic.
Even though the project is planned around the amount of time we have, it could end up as too large if we consider coordinating between ourselves consumes time.

|Licenses
|We have limited resources, and some of the licenses that could be interesting to try are not included in the ones provided by our studen accounts.
Still, the software itself is free, so this could be considered a minor inconvenience.

|Study materials
|There are a lot of technologies on this course that are new to us, and require us to find courses and books to study them.
There are some materials about them for free, but of course the best books and courses are locked behind a paywall.

|Coordination issues
|The problems that may come from working with other people, distributing the tasks and making code understandable by others somehow also limits the development of the project.

|Formation
|The less knowledge we have on this technologies, the more time and effort we will have to spend learning about them.
Our lack of use of most of the tools presented in this project makes the need for study materials and more free time worse.
